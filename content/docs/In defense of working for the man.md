When you step out of a role where you have a boss and into a more self-directed role (like an entrepreneur, upper management, C-suite, etc.) you become less specialized. You have less time to devote to your craft. 

You need to spend more time selling, managing people, fixing mistakes, developing underlings, leading, etc. You're no longer on the path to becoming an expert. Thus, it may be defensible for some people to remain under a boss (in sharp contradiction to the "stick it to the man"/"be your own boss" dogma).
